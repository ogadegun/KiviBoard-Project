# KiviBoard-Project
Academic Group Project developing a grid-based game with accessibility features


KiviBoard is a turn-based board game developed as part of a software engineering course at Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) during the Winter 2025 semester (January–April 2025). The project was completed as a group assignment and focused on applying object-oriented design principles, GUI development, and collaborative software practices in Java.

My primary contribution to the project was implementing accessibility features for users with colour vision deficiencies. This included the use of tooltips and high-contrast borders around board grids to ensure that game state and interactions remained clear without relying solely on colour cues.
