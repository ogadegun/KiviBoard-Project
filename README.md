# KiviBoard-Project
Academic Group Project developing a grid-based game with accessibility features

Project Overview

KiviBoard is a turn-based board game developed as part of a Software Engineering course at Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) during the Winter 2025 semester (January–April 2025). The project was completed as a group assignment, focusing on object-oriented design principles, GUI development in Java, and collaborative software practices.


## Accessibility Contribution

My primary contribution was implementing accessibility features to make the game more inclusive. Specifically:

Tooltips were added to indicate game states

Borders were used to differentiate grid squares for users with colour vision deficiencies

## How to Run

Due to copyright restrictions, the source code cannot be publicly shared. A runnable JAR file has been provided.

## Instructions

Download or clone the repository containing the JAR.

Open a terminal in the folder containing the JAR.
